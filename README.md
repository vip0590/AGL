# AGL

Visual Studio 2010 has been used to create a Console Application using C# language.

Program.cs is used to call a method defined in JsonData.cs that returns the Json String from the Web Service. The JSON string is then deserialized and the name of the cats are displayed in the alphabetical order in the given format.

I have used System.Web.Extensions that helps in creating the JavaScriptSerializer Object.
